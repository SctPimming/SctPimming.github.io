I am Sakrapee Namsak, a second-year master student at VISTEC. I am advised by [Dr. Sucha Supittayapornpong](https://vistec.ist/faculty-member/sucha), in the [Network and Decision Systems (NDS) Lab](https://vistec.ist/network). My Current research topic included
* Iterative Method
* Federated Learning
* Convex and non-convex optimization

## News
* August 4th, 2023 – Our paper on [An Asynchronous Subgradient-Proximal Method for Solving Additive Convex Optimization Problems] is accepted for publication in Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computing.
* April 6th, 2023 – Our paper on [A distributed proximal gradient method with time-varying delays for solving additive convex optimizations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S259003742300016X) is accepted for publication in Results in Applied Mathematics.
